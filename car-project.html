    <h1 id="about" align="center"><i>Presenting the ford Figo</i></h1>
      Ford Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational
      automobile manufacturer headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, United
      States. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903.
      The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford
      brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian
      SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United
      Kingdom and a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.[8] It also has joint
      ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand
      (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed
      on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they
      have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.
    </p>
  <p>Lincoln Motor Company was founded in 1917 by Henry M. Leland, naming it after Abraham Lincoln. In February 1922, the company was acquired by Ford,[8][9] its parent company to this day. Following World War II, Ford formed the Lincoln-Mercury Division, pairing Lincoln with its mid-range Mercury brand; the pairing lasted through the 2010 closure of Mercury. At the end of 2012, Lincoln reverted to its original name, Lincoln Motor Company.[9][10] Following the divestiture of Premier Automotive Group (Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Volvo) and the closure of Mercury, Lincoln remains the sole luxury nameplate of Ford Motor Company.</p>
