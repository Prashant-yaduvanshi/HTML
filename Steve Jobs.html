      Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American
      business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman,
      and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member
      of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition
      of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of
      the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his
      early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
    </p>

      Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American
      mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College
      in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through
      India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and
      Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
      computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
      production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful
      mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the
      Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
      interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple
      Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first
      mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop
      publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
      the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.

      In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the
      company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took
      a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
      development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and
      business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects
      industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's
      Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D
      computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a
      major animation studio, producing over 25 films since
    </p>

      In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of
      NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the
      verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to
      develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications,
      beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to
      the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and
      iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the
      completely new Mac OS X (later known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP
      platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for
      the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor
      in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple.
      In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
